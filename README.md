# ELEC5305-project

This is the source code for ELEC5305 project
In this project, I utilized the ESPnet toolkit which focused on the end-to-end signal processing.

This repo consists of 2 DEMO in Jupyter notebook. They are originally encoded in Colab and should be executed on Colab as well
The example audio signals are imported in the DEMO, but my testing signals are meant to be upload manually.






ESPnet toolkit is available: https://github.com/espnet/espnet
Its documentation is available: https://espnet.github.io/espnet/
