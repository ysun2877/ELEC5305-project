# ELEC5305-project

This is the source code for ELEC5305 project

In this project, I utilized the ESPnet toolkit which focused on the end-to-end signal processing.

This repo consists of 2 DEMO in Jupyter Notebook. They are originally encoded in Colab and should be executed on Colab as well.

The example audio signals are imported in the DEMO, but my testing signals are meant to be uploaded manually.

ASR demo: The demonstration of Automatic signal recognition

Speech enhancement demo: The demonstration of Speech enhancement

Noisy_sr=16000: The noisy audio signal with sampling rate = 16000: speech + ambient noise

Mixed1_sr=8000: 2 mixed audio with sampling rate = 8000: speech from 2 men

Mixed2_sr=8000: 2 mixed audio with sampling rate = 8000: speech from 1 man and 1 woman
